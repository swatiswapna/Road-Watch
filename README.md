# Road Watch

## Project Overview

"Road Watch" is a computer vision project designed to enhance road safety by detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet. The system uses a YOLO model to check helmet usage. If the model determines that the person is not wearing a helmet, it proceeds to detect the vehicle's number plate. The future scope includes retrieving data about the vehicle's owner from a database and providing a basic frontend to display the results. Additionally, the project aims to incorporate advanced techniques for motion deblurring using Nafnet models.

## Features

- Helmet Detection: Uses a trained model to identify whether a person is wearing a helmet.
- Number Plate Detection: If no helmet is detected, the system will detect the number plate of the vehicle.
- Future Enhancements:
  - Retrieve and display data of the guilty vehicle owner from a database.
  - Develop a basic frontend to show detection results.
  - Implement NAFNET models to reduce motion blur and improve detection accuracy.
